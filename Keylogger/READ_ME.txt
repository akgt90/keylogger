KEYLOGGER
-a software program designed to secretly monitor and log all keystrokes.
-doesn’t have to be software – it can also be a device. Keylogging devices are much rarer.
Cases in which it would be legal and appropriate to use keyloggers::
	Parental control: parents can track what their children do on the Internet
	Company security: tracking the use of computers for non-work-related purposes
	Law enforcement: using keylogger records to analyze and track incidents linked to the use of personal computers;


They can pose a serious threat to users, as they can be used to intercept passwords and other confidential information 
entered via the keyboard. As a result, cyber criminals can get PIN codes and account numbers for e-payment systems
,passwords to online gaming accounts, email addresses, user names, email passwords etc.
